## About Me

<!-- TODO: Complete. -->

Busy student studying game design. Looking to get busier. **Alaa Ramzi.**

Since high school, I held a strong passion for art through digital mediums. I am now a full-time college student at the University of New Haven, studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design.

As of the start of 2024, I am looking for opportunities to put my skills to use.

## Projects & Accomplishments

### Game Programming

#### **Mirror Game:** Game Jam Winner. Proficiency in Unity.

A simple puzzle game where you control two characters at the same time.

This game was made in under 48 hours, winning a local university held game jam.

#### **Hare:** Game Engine Creation. Early Proficiency with C++.

A very, very basic 2D platformer game that's not about rabbits.

I get more in-depth about both the technology and the history behind this project than anything else listed here. To summarize, **I made a 2D game engine from scratch in under two months.**
