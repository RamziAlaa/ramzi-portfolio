## About Me

<!-- TODO: Complete. -->

Busy student studying game design. Looking to get busier. **Alaa Ramzi.**

Since high school, I held a strong passion for art through digital mediums. I am now a full-time college student at the University of New Haven, studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design.

As of the start of 2024, Ramzi is still looking for opportunities to put his skills to use.

## Projects & Accomplishments

### Game Programming

#### **un»ruin:** Making Character Controllers. Proficiency in Godot.

A very early project that I have begun recently. I'm very proud of the structure for my player controller.

#### **Hare:** Game Engine Creation. Early Proficiency with C++.

A very, very basic 2D platformer game that's not about rabbits.

I get more in-depth about both the technology and the history behind this project than anything else listed here. To summarize, **I made a 2D game engine from scratch in under two months.**

#### **Mirror Game:** Game Jam Winner. Proficiency in Unity.

A simple puzzle game where you control two characters at the same time.

This game was made in under 48 hours, winning a local university held game jam.

### Other Skills

#### Narrative Design

Last summer, a very close friend had mentioned to me that she was going to participate at an OCT (Original Character Tournament). 

OCT's at their core, are writing competitions. Whether through an illustrative or literary medium, participants are entered in a bracket over whose work is "the best." Although I haven't won the tournament, I was met with a lot of positive feedback. Those who read my work said that it stayed with them for weeks at a time, longer than any other work they've consumed in the tournament at the time.

I adore writing and world-building, and would love to help lend a hand with the narrative design of a game whenever possible.

You can check out the OCT I've worked on [here.](https://summerleaguesoct.com/about/) You can also [check out my works in that tournament](https://wiki.summerleaguesoct.com/books/2024-writer-camellia-league/page/woodensponge-creator-page) as well, along with a [reference sheet](https://wiki.summerleaguesoct.com/books/2024-writer-camellia-league/page/quin) I wrote for the contestants.

#### Music Composition

Back when I was around sixteen-years-old, I had decided to help a friend out with modding a game called [*Rain World.*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/) I helped with programming and music. I was very new to making music at the time, but that changed when I ended up making **50+ tracks** in the span of two years. They were all made with a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), particularly [*LMMS.*](https://lmms.io/) However, I use [*REAPER*](https://www.reaper.fm/) now and never looked back.

The project grew into a monstrous size, and my friend is still working on it to this day. Although I stopped programming for the project due to a lack of time, I still *occasionally* send new tracks, sounds, and music.

Furthermore, I made a three-minute song for someone's birthday about a year ago (2023). It's technically my latest work, especially since I've been putting more of a focus on studying narrative design.

I can't share everything, but you can find examples in the repository's `/music/` folder.
