## About Me

![Unity Badge 1](.md-media/unity-certified-associate-game-developer.png)  https://www.credly.com/go/nwUYbkh5

Busy student studying game design. Looking to get busier.

Since high school, I held a strong passion for art through digital mediums. I am now a full-time college student at the University of New Haven, studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design.

As of the start of 2024, I am looking for opportunities to put my skills to use.
