## Current Work

### Sound Designer for Melessthanthree

Currently, I'm working as a sound designer, programmer, and assistant writer for a work-in-progress RPG game made by the creator of [Death of a Wish](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2302080/Death_of_a_Wish/) and [Luca: Born of a Dream](https://store.steampowered.com/app/896460/Lucah_Born_of_a_Dream/).

As of now, I have made dozens of sound effects for the game. Furthermore, I have implemented multiple systems to allow for a dynamic soundscape, including procedural level ambience.

You can find the SFX that I have made at the time of writing this in `sounds/mystery-game-rpg/`.
