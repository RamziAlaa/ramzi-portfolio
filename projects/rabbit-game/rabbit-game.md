# Rabbit Game



This was my senior project back in high school. It's a game where you move a square in a level. There's no goal, but you can have fun moving very fast.

As for the *engine* it's running on, it's *completely made from the ground up.* It uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) as a rendering engine, but that's about it when it comes to third-party libraries.
